[See my site here.](https://www.tojimjiang.com)

Just kidding. I am a technologist that wants to sharpen my tool kit, especially being able to deploy projects from scratch. I am already stable with computer hardware and networking. But still want to sharpen my programming chops.

I currently do some freelance work as a web designer and wild card for a digital marketing company called [Angry Apples Marketing](www.goangry.com). _Note, I did NOT make their website, but sadly have to maintain it_. 

But, getting to who I really am, I see myself as a pseudo-self-starter. I rarely ever start myself, and that has to be my biggest downfall. But, once galvainzed by some impetus or stimulus, I aim to churn out a beautiful project as soon as possible.
