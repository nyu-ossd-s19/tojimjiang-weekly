# Group Project Updates
It seems like there was a change to Travis CI, so like all the tests are failing now. Or, rather tests fail pseudo-randomly, and most of the Blockly team doesn't seem to know what to so in regards to it. 

I tried to submit a code cleanup fix to make xml loads asynchronous, but working async-ly makes loads even longer (but less resource intensive), and really fails Travis CI badly.

Also, I tried to test locally, but I have been having issue after issue in getting the testing scripts to work locally. Infact now, I get 3 types of errors, one being eslint from just git, and two issues being modules or files being unable to be found or loaded to run the testing script.

Also, I did spend a large chunk of time making our presentation presentable, and for that I am happy, especially how beautiful our slides came out. 

Hopefully after the testing scripts and my PR get accepted I can look at RTL again and might be able to find a clean resolution to my partial solution, which currently works, mostly, sometimes.

Looking forward, I hope to be able to see or even possibly help to resolve the tidal wave of testing errors (Travis CI) on the project, as many (perfectly fine) builds are now failing.
