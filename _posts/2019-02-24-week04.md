## Summary assesment

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Rarely, but ususally for what would be to a developer time wasting bugs that need fixing.

# Blog Post
## Bootstrap
### What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a CSS/HTML/JS framework that lets you style a webpage/app very quickly. Letting you layout elements beautifully with some sense of style, that far exceeds raw HTML, and for relatively low amounts of effort (compared to pure CSS, and pure JS).
### Why did I pick bootstrap?
I personally do like bootstrap to make very quick webpages by using the built in grid functionailty that allows for beautiful layouts across all devices with minimal effort and time. I personally did like off the shelf bootstrap quite a lot. I did have some initial growing pains using it, as I was coming from a pure CSS world. But, cosindering the time spend tinkering CSS, I found the value in bootstrap in getting a presentable webpage/app in seconds*.

*Seconds being a unit of time, not a descriptor of the speed of how fast/easy Bootstrap is to use/implement/style a webpage/app.
