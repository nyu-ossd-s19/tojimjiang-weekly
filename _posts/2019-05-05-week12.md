# Group Project Updates

This past week I've been trying to complete the RTL rendering issue that I have been working on, but encounted a ton of issues to get a properly functioning solution to work. Also, in our group we spent a larger portion of our time preparing for our presentation, as we would be going on Monday.

I have a janky-partial solution, where for most elements it renders correctly, even when there are too few elements to render. But, some elements report an incorrect width value, leading to select elements rendering incorrectly. These issues may be possible bugs, that I will be researching into. 

Also in the process, Tiara and I discovered other inconsistent behaviors in Blockly, that might be more bug issues.

These factors really hampered my group's ability to contribute to Blockly this week, but we hope to find a resolution, or at a minimum provide our findings to the project, so someone else might be able to resolve some of the smaller bugs in our own issue fix.
