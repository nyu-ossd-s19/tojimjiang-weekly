# Personal Progress On Team Project
## What I Have Done
I have worked on understanding what blockly is, and worked on looking at issues that I can handle. 

I have already made one pull request, that got accepted, on the project to resolve an issue about a Dath math generator implementation pulling from the wrong library.

## What I Learnt
I learnt about how Blockly works and how to contribute to it, as the contribution guide could be more clear especially about where to contribute and how to actually develop and where to push changes. I also learnt how to start running some generator tests for Blockly, as this Google project, still requires Firefox to test. (Chrome doesn't actually work for script loading).

## Next Week
Looking forward to the next week, I would like to resolve more issues, whether code clean up or actual additions to documentation, as I start to understand more and more of how blockly works.

# Wikipedia
I think the people to contribute to Wikipedia have interests in the subject they are contributing about, have a motive to contribute, like marketing/advertising, personal gain, or just to help people.

I think I might become a regular contributor to Wikipedia one day because I can help provide information and sources to back up my findings in some niche topics that I am interested in.

I will select the articles to contribute for the class mainly from articles that need cleanup that only have small minor issues like formatting and links, that don't need me to be well versed in the subject matter.
