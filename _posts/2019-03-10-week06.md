# HFOSS
I think HFOSS projects are harder to get involved with. HFOSS projects aim to more clearly seperate the product and the code behind it. This makes it hard to find the GitHub repositories for many of these HFOSS projects. Adding to the difficulty of getting involved is that many projects have a nuche use case, which leads to a small community. This small community can be a blessing or a curse. A small community can be very tight knit, and there would be less conflict. On the other hard, a small community can act exclusive, or be dead. If the community is too small, issues don't get resolved, or not even created. Pull requests are left out, and the code base for the project simply stops getting updated. Lastly, some HFOSS projects try to act like a product so much, that they only use GitHub as a code warehouse, and have other means to handle issue tracking, (an example would be OpenMRS).

I think there is less prestige to the contributor, compared to other open source projects, because of the smaller user base as compared to other open source projects. I think prestige is related to the exposure and install base of the software project, and due to HFOSS projects typically having very niche uses, there are simply fewer users.

I personally would not want to work on HFOSS projects like ones I have seen, because the communities are somewhat inactive, or have illogical workflows outside of GitHub (looking at you OpenMRS). Also, as I feel there is less prestige on working on HFOSS projects, I would rather spend my time on projects that have larger install bases that other software engineers may have heard of before.

## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__License:__ MIT License

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__ Yes

__Programming Language:__ Mainly Ruby on Rails (70%+)

__URL for contributing instructions:__ None.

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ There are no contributing instructions.


__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ There is no code of conduct, community norms, or community guidelines.

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__ [https://github.com/codeforamerica/clientcomm-rails](https://github.com/codeforamerica/clientcomm-rails)


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ There are two versions, for local and cloud deployement. I think both sets of instructions could be better, as the instructions only go over configuring dependencies. There is a lack on any documentation about how to use ClientComm in general. To, me I don't even know how to set up the package to run, just looking at their directions.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ Very unfriendly. The instructions are poor, and there is no really activity in the repository. Compounding to the issues is that the repository lacks contributing guidelines, community guidelines, actual issues, and friendly issue labels.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Not really, as many of the closed issues are simply closed by a maintainer with no further input by anyone.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
The people in the comments act friendly and professional. But, this is on issues that have comments. Many issues/PRs have no community comments.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Originally, not really, as most PRs were from the maintainers themselves. But, for old outside PRs, they were reviews. Lately, there have been no recent PRs to get a compareable value.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Ususally for outside contributions. Inside contributions lack these comments.
