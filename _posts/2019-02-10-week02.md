# Extension Updates
I have worked to make the future installation procedure more frictionless. Now providing a redirect to a copy to clipboard for about:debugging. 

Also learnt how SVG filters worked, to be able to create a basic SVG filter, that reduces blue light intensity.

# Extension State/Status
Developed pathway on how the extension will work. We will use SVG filters that will be injected in HTML and directed to by CSS.

Some issues I faced is the basic css - filter, only works elementwise.

That means background elements wouldn't change, so that would require background to be modified seperate. 

Also a major and still current issue is just getting the addon to work. The browser action doesn't seem to fire the add on at all. But, making it a context script on certain pages brings up other issues, where CSS won't get injected, even with activeTab permissions in the extension.

# Git/Github
I have learnt about how to make a local clone of a repository, and how to merge without streamrolling all merges. And learnt how to make a pull request and followups, like making any necessary changes.
